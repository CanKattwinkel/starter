# Branching

It is recommended to work in feature branches. So usually create a branch for each ticket. When your work is done create a pull request in order to drive your changes into the master branch again. Usually another team member should review your pull-request and then either accept or decline your changes. 

Pay attention to your commit messages since they are used in order to generate the changelog. See the corresponding story for more information.
